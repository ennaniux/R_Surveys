title: Survey analysis with R

# R_Surveys

Some code using R and the survey package.

##  Introduction

This is code that I have been developing in order to make survey analysis in a more systematic way.

The core of the functions defined here is the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/][survey package]].

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

print("Hello MD")

```
